# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis
In this scenario, we are working as a data analyst for PyBer, a Python-based ride-share company/app. We are tasked with performing an exporatory analysis on ride data to discover the relationship between different cities, the number of riders, the number of drivers, and provide various summary statistics based on the type of city. Our goal is to help improve access to ride share services and improve affordability of rides in underserved neighborhoods. With this new analysis, we created a summary DataFrame including ride-sharing data by city type. Using this information, we created a visualization to show the total weekly fares for each city type.  

## Results
### Summary of Data by City Type
![Image of Summary Data by City Type](https://github.com/jpb12002/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Summary_Data_By_City_Type.png)
- The total number of rides is significantly higher in Urban cities than any other type, with 1,000 more rides than the next highest city type which is Suburban. Rural type cities had the fewest number of total rides. 
- The total number of drivers is significantly higher in Urban cities than any other type, with almost 2,000 more drivers than the next highest city type which is Suburban. Rural type cities had the fewest number of total drivers.  
- The total amount of fares collected is significantly higher in Urban cities than any other type, with $20,000.00 more collected than the next highest city type which is suburban. Rural type cities had the fewest amount of total fares collected. 
- There is an inverse relationship between the number of rides in city type and the average fare per ride. Rural type cities have the fewest number of rides, but the average fare per ride is the highest compared to the other types of cities.
