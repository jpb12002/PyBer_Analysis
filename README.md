# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis
In this scenario, we are working as a data analyst for PyBer, a Python-based ride-share company/app. We are tasked with performing an exporatory analysis on ride data to discover the relationship between different cities, the number of riders, the number of drivers, and provide various summary statistics based on the type of city. Our goal is to help improve access to ride share services and improve affordability of rides in underserved neighborhoods. With this new analysis, we created a summary DataFrame including ride-sharing data by city type. Using this information, we created a visualization to show the total weekly fares for each city type.  

## Results
### Summary of Data by City Type

- The total number of rides is significantly higher in Urban cities than any other type, with 1,000 more rides than the next highest city type which is Suburban. Rural type cities had the fewest number of total rides. 
- The total number of drivers is significantly higher in Urban cities than any other type, with almost 2,000 more drivers than the next highest city type which is Suburban. Rural type cities had the fewest number of total drivers.  
- The total amount of fares collected is significantly higher in Urban cities than any other type, with $20,000.00 more collected than the next highest city type which is suburban. Rural type cities had the fewest amount of total fares collected. 
- There is an inverse relationship between the number of rides in a city type and the average fare per ride. Rural type cities have the fewest number of rides, but the average fare per ride is the highest compared to the other types of cities.  
- There is an inverse relationship between the number of drivers in a city type and the average fare per driver. Rural type cities have the fewest number of driver, but the average fare per driver is significantly higher compared to the other types of cities. 

### Weekly Summary of Fares by City Type

- The the total fares collected on a weekly basis is highest in Urban city types, with these cities collecting between $2000-$2500 per week. Suburban city types had the second highest total fares collected on a weekly basis, with these cities collecting between $1000-$1500 per week. Rural city types had the lowest total fares collected on a weekly basis, with these cities collecting between <$100-$500 per week. 
- The amount of fares collected in each city type is fairly consistent from week to week, with no significant deviations in the trend lines. Interestingly, all three city types had a spike in fares collected in the last week of February.
