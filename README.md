# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis
In this scenario, we are working as a data analyst for PyBer, a Python-based ride-share company/app. We are tasked with performing an exporatory analysis on ride data to discover the relationship between different cities, the number of riders, the number of drivers, and provide various summary statistics based on the type of city. Our goal is to help improve access to ride share services and improve affordability of rides in underserved neighborhoods. With this new analysis, we created a summary DataFrame including ride-sharing data by city type. Using this information, we created a visualization to show the total weekly fares for each city type.
